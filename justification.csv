No poverty,1.1,"By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day ","The heavy dependence on imported equipment, technology, and expertise for green hydrogen production and end-use poses a risk of limiting the economic benefits and job opportunities that could have been generated domestically. Additionally, if investments and policies related to green hydrogen prioritize foreign entities or neglect the inclusion of local communities, it has the potential to worsen existing disparities and hinder poverty reduction efforts. In the case of Africa, green hydrogen production can pose the highest risk (red flag) to the progress towards the target due to poor working conditions and lower gross domestic product/purchasing power parity per capita compared to those of other countries.

Green hydrogen production can increase renewable energy production capacity by replacing fossil fuels and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. The transportation can provide system integration (e.g. seasonal storage) and avoid using fossil fuels, as seen in India. In the end-use, green hydrogen can decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors (e.g. steel, cement, chemical industry, refineries, and aluminum). All these actions can mitigate the potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change. Most countries have already worked on mitigation actions to 2030, using green hydrogen. To meet this target, the presence of the entire value chain at the local level can provide clean energy solutions that mitigate climate-related risks and create local economic stability.","(1) IRENA.

In addition, green hydrogen has the positive potential to decarbonize multiple sectors reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Green hydrogen production can contribute to the replacement of fossil fuels and decrease pollution when the electricity used to produce green hydrogen comes from green methods. Green hydrogen transportation remains a challenge when fossil fuels are used as the fuel source for transporting green hydrogen, for example, in ships. However, green ammonia and green hydrogen may become the main fuel for zero carbon emissions of ships in the future. Green hydrogen end-use can reduce air pollution and avoid deaths and breathing illnesses, particularly in sectors such as transport. In some European countries, there are actions to decarbonize the transport sector by 2030, mainly to avoid local pollution. Meanwhile, in developing countries, replacing fossil fuels in this freight transportation is one of the main challenges foreseen in the medium-term. ","(1) Lao J, Song H, Wang C, Zhou Y.
