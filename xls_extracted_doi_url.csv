Africa has been identified as a potential key player in the production of green hydrogen not only for itself but also for other countries in Europe. There are however several factors that may either positively or negatively affect the development of green hydrogen on the continent. This study identified some opportunities and barriers to the production of green hydrogen in Africa and used the multi-criteria decision-making approach to prioritize them. The study identified the opportunity to export to EU market (20.90%), availability of RE resources (34.88%), youthful population (13.95%), Agenda 2063 (9.30%), and ammonia production (20.90%) as some of the opportunities available on the continent. The availability of RE resources was selected as the highest opportunity for the development of hydrogen energy in Africa. High cost of hydrogen (11.78%), dealing with the status-quo (8.82%), corruption in the energy sector (4.52%), land availability issues (7.06%), political instabilities and insecurity in certain parts of the continent (11.76%), lack of the needed skills and education (11.76%), limited supporting infrastructure and financing (15.38%), and lack of the needed regulatory and legal framework (28.95%) were identified as some of the barriers that could affect the development and use of hydrogen in Africa.

Green hydrogen production can increase renewable energy production capacity by replacing fossil fuels and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. The transportation can provide system integration (e.g. seasonal storage) and avoid using fossil fuels, as seen in India. In the end-use, green hydrogen can decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors (e.g. steel, cement, chemical industry, refineries, and aluminum). All these actions can mitigate the potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change. Most countries have already worked on mitigation actions to 2030, using green hydrogen. To meet this target, the presence of the entire value chain at the local level can provide clean energy solutions that mitigate climate-related risks and create local economic stability.|0","(1) IRENA.

Here, we fill the need for a comprehensive definition of the ‘hydrogen economy’ and illustrate a vision in which hydrogen will primarily be used for decarbonization where no alternative exists. We propose a three-phase implementation plan for hydrogen into the industrial sector as a chemical feedstock, the transportation sector for long-range, heavy-duty vehicles, the buildings sector for heat, and the power sector for seasonal storage. We find that hydrogen will not be the largest energy economy, but with a projected need of 2.3 Gt H2 annually, it can decarbonize around 18% of energy-related sectors.

Here, we evaluate the economic benefits of producing green ammonia from renewable local hydropower for low-carbon cost-effective fertilizer production. Its use as fertilizer estimates a 30-year net present value (NPV) of ∼$230M (∼165% return of investment) compared with simply importing fertilizers, which would already save at least $50M a year compared with the current situation of importing rice, but hinges on additional external factors related to implementing modern agriculture.

Green hydrogen is considered a potential candidate for fossil fuel soon—however, hydrogen is facing the challenges of storage and transportation. Green ammonia, with its ease of transport and storage, is another promising alternative. Decarbonizing ammonia production is an environmental press toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. This work summarizes the up-to-date progress in the green ammonia production methods. An assessment of the different production methods was conducted to highlight the merits and constraints of each approach. Moreover, the promising applications of green ammonia in the energy sectors were discussed. The various barriers, i.e., technical, economic, environmental, and regulations and policies, facing the widespread of green ammonia were also discussed. Finally, the contribution of green ammonia in achieving the different sustainable development goals was elaborated, focusing on the contribution of green ammonia in achieving climate change (SDG 13), clean energy (SDG 7), and other sustainability-related goals. Low efficiencies, high cost, and negative environmental impacts are the common challenges of the various production methods. The progress in green ammonia is essential for achieving SDG2, “Zero hunger”. SDG3 “healthy life and well-being” and SDG13 “Climate action”, will be achieved by eliminating 3.85\xa0kg CO2-eq/kg NH3 emitted from conventional ammonia-based processes. Ease storing of green ammonia in liquid form (at 9\xa0bar or cooling to −33°); makes it the best green energy source, i.e., achieving SDG7 “green and affordable energy”. By2050, green ammonia is expected to represent 99\xa0% of marine fuel, thus contributing to SDG9 “Industry and Infrastructure”. Moreover, green ammonia production will save 35.2 GJ of natural gas, thus achieving SDG12 “Responsible consumption/production”.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Energy Conversion and Management', 'year': '2023', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.rser.2022.112705', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1016/j.rser.2022.112705', 'title': 'Renewable hydrogen economy outlook in Africa ', 'abstract': '\n                  Hydrogen presents an opportunity for Africa to not only decarbonise its own energy use and enable clean energy access for all, but also to export renewable energy. This paper developed a framework for assessing renewable resources for hydrogen production and provides a new critical analysis as to how and what role hydrogen can play in the complex African energy landscape. The regional solar, wind, CSP, and bio hydrogen potential ranges from 366 to 1311\xa0Gt/year, 162 to 1782\xa0Gt/year, 463 to 2738\xa0Gt/year, and 0.03 to 0.06\xa0Gt/year respectively. The water availability and sensitivity results showed that the water shortages in some countries can be abated by importing water from regions with high renewable water resources. A techno-economic comparative analysis indicated that a high voltage direct current (HVDC) system presents the most cost-effective transportation system with overall costs per kg hydrogen of 0.038 $/kg, followed by water pipeline with 0.084 $/kg, seawater desalination 0.1 $/kg, liquified hydrogen tank truck 0.12 $/kg, compressed hydrogen pipeline 0.16 $/kg, liquefied ammonia pipeline 0.38 $/kg, liquefied ammonia tank truck 0.60 $/kg, and compressed hydrogen tank truck with 0.77 $/kg. The results quantified the significance of economies of scale due to cost effectiveness of systems such as compressed hydrogen pipeline and liquefied hydrogen tank truck systems when hydrogen production is scaled up.

Here, we evaluate the economic benefits of producing green ammonia from renewable local hydropower for low-carbon cost-effective fertilizer production. Its use as fertilizer estimates a 30-year net present value (NPV) of ∼$230M (∼165% return of investment) compared with simply importing fertilizers, which would already save at least $50M a year compared with the current situation of importing rice, but hinges on additional external factors related to implementing modern agriculture. In addition, green ammonia can buffer seasonal fluctuations of hydroelectricity from 900 MW to 50 MW and produce a consistently available 370 MW of power.

In addition, green hydrogen has the positive potential to decarbonize multiple sectors reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Green hydrogen production can contribute to the replacement of fossil fuels and decrease pollution when the electricity used to produce green hydrogen comes from green methods. Green hydrogen transportation remains a challenge when fossil fuels are used as the fuel source for transporting green hydrogen, for example, in ships. However, green ammonia and green hydrogen may become the main fuel for zero carbon emissions of ships in the future. Green hydrogen end-use can reduce air pollution and avoid deaths and breathing illnesses, particularly in sectors such as transport. In some European countries, there are actions to decarbonize the transport sector by 2030, mainly to avoid local pollution. Meanwhile, in developing countries, replacing fossil fuels in this freight transportation is one of the main challenges foreseen in the medium-term. |0","(1) Lao J, Song H, Wang C, Zhou Y.

With present costs of wind and solar electricity, it is shown that, when electricity from renewable sources replaces electricity from natural gas, the cost of air pollution emission abatement is more than ten times less than the cost if hydrogen from renewable sources replaces hydrogen produced from natural gas. When renewable-based hydrogen is used instead of gasoline in a fuel cell vehicle, the cost of air pollution emissions reduction approaches the same value as for renewable-based electricity only if the fuel cell vehicle efficiency exceeds significantly (i.e., by about two times) that of an internal combustion vehicle.

The main focus is on the demonstration of a fundamental difference in the generation of irreversibility during combustion between hydrogen and hydrocarbons. This difference relates to the mechanisms of entropy generation during the oxidation reaction of the two fuels and yields the particularly attractive characteristic of a monotonic decrease in combustion irreversibility with increasing hydrogen content of the fuel, for mole fractions of hydrogen smaller than 10%. This reduction in combustion irreversibility is reflected in an increase in second law efficiency with increasing proportions of hydrogen. The exhaust gas availability at the end of the closed part of the cycle was found to have a local maximum for a hydrogen mole fraction of the order of 5%. These trends with respect to hydrogen also apply when the fuel is diluted with a significant amount of CO2 (of the order of 40%, as for example in the case for landfill gas), although the absolute value of each of the terms of the availability balance is affected strongly by the dilution.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'International Journal of Hydrogen Energy', 'year': '2006', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.seta.2022.102762', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1016/j.seta.2022.102762', 'title': 'A review of low and zero carbon fuel technologies: Achieving ship carbon reduction targets ', 'abstract': '\n                  The shipping industry has paid unprecedented attention to reducing emissions and pollution in recent years. In particular, the International Maritime Organization has enacted many regulations on ship emissions, and the industry has increasingly focused on the development and application of low-carbon marine fuels. The use of low carbon alternative fuels can effectively solve the current environmental and energy problems. At present, the alternative fuels available for ships include liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, methanol, biodiesel, hydrogen and ammonia, etc. In the short term, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, methanol technology is more mature, which can be applied to ships. In the long term, biodiesel, hydrogen fuel and ammonia fuel will inevitably become the mainstream of alternative fuels for ships. However, there are some challenges in the use of alternative fuels, such as leakage of liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas, low calorific value of methanol and biodiesel, and difficult storage of hydrogen and ammonia. This work will summarize and analyze the utilization potentiality of low carbon alternative fuel, low carbon combustion technologies for ships, and some of the new clean power technologies, which has important guiding significance for the development of low carbon fuel for ships in the future.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments', 'year': '2022', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.05.217', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.05.217', 'title': 'Towards the Hydrogen Economy in Paraguay: Green hydrogen production potential and end-uses ', 'abstract': '\n                  This study was conducted to estimate the potential for green H2 in Paraguay. A total production potential of 22.5\xa0×\xa0106 tons/year was obtained with a main contribution (93.34%) from solar photovoltaic. The greatest potential for producing H2 from solar and wind resources is in the Western region, and from hydro resources is in the Eastern region of the country. Two end-uses of green H2 were assessed: (1) automotive transportation, replacing gasoline and diesel; and (2) residential energy, replacing firewood and LPG for cooking in households across the country. In 16 of the 17 departments, green H2 is able to replace the overall consumption of gasoline and diesel, as well as firewood and LPG. Finally, energy service cost (mobility), environmental aspects and CO2 emissions were considered for three urban mobility technologies for the Metropolitan Area of Asunción. Results show that the mobility cost of fuel cell hybrid electric buses is still very high in comparison to diesel buses and battery electric buses. However, when a longer driving range is required, fuel cell hybrid electric buses could become a viable alternative in the long term. From an environmental point of view, green H2 used in fuel cell hybrid electric buses has the potential to save about 96% of CO2 emissions in comparison to diesel buses. It is concluded that the estimated green H2 production potential favors the incorporation of the Hydrogen Economy in Paraguay.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'International Journal of Hydrogen Energy', 'year': '2022', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1038/s41893-022-01039-', 'doi_repaired': '10.1016/0360-3199(84)90191-5', 'repair_note': 'repaired_by_generic_search:10.1038/s41893-022-01039-', 'doi': '10.1016/0360-3199(84)90191-5', 'title': 'Method of removing hydrogen sulfide from gases utilizing a polyvalent metal chelate solution and regenerating the solution in a fuel cell ', 'abstract': '', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'International Journal of Hydrogen Energy', 'year': '1984', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/s2542-5196(21)00201-1', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1016/s2542-5196(21)00201-1', 'title': 'Air pollution and development in Africa: impacts on health, the economy, and human capital ', 'abstract': '\n                  Background\n                  Africa is undergoing both an environmental and an epidemiological transition. Household air pollution is the predominant form of air pollution, but it is declining, whereas ambient air pollution is increasing. We aimed to quantify how air pollution is affecting health, human capital, and the economy across Africa, with a particular focus on Ethiopia, Ghana, and Rwanda.\n               \n                  Methods\n                  Data on household and ambient air pollution were from WHO Global Health Observatory, and data on morbidity and mortality were from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study. We estimated economic output lost due to air pollution-related disease by country, with use of labour income per worker, adjusted by the probability that a person (of a given age) was working. Losses were expressed in 2019 international dollars and as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP). We also quantified the contribution of particulate matter (PM)2·5 pollution to intelligence quotient (IQ) loss in children younger than 10 years, with use of an exposure–response coefficient based on previously published data.\n               \n                  Findings\n                  Air pollution was responsible for 1·1 million deaths across Africa in 2019. Household air pollution accounted for 697\u2008000 deaths and ambient air pollution for 394\u2008000. Ambient air pollution-related deaths increased from 361\u2008000 in 2015, to 383\u2008000 in 2019, with the greatest increases in the most highly developed countries. The majority of deaths due to ambient air pollution are caused by non-communicable diseases. The loss in economic output in 2019 due to air pollution-related morbidity and mortality was $3·02 billion in Ethiopia (1·16% of GDP), $1·63 billion in Ghana (0·95% of GDP), and $349 million in Rwanda (1·19% of GDP). PM2·5 pollution was estimated to be responsible for 1·96 billion lost IQ points in African children in 2019.\n               \n                  Interpretation\n                  Ambient air pollution is increasing across Africa. In the absence of deliberate intervention, it will increase morbidity and mortality, diminish economic productivity, impair human capital formation, and undercut development. Because most African countries are still early in development, they have opportunities to transition rapidly to wind and solar energy, avoiding a reliance on fossil fuel-based economies and minimising pollution.\n               \n                  Funding\n                  UN Environment Programme.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'The Lancet Planetary Health', 'year': '2021', 'pdf_url': 'http://www.thelancet.com/article/S2542519621002011/pdf', 'pdf_source': 'unpaywall', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'request_failed', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/s2542-5196', 'doi_repaired': '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.11.074', 'repair_note': 'repaired_by_elsevier_s_prefix:10.1016/s2542-5196', 'doi': '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.11.074', 'title': 'Study on the stratification of the blended gas in the pipeline with hydrogen into natural gas ', 'abstract': '\n                  When blending hydrogen into existing natural gas pipelines, the non-uniform concentration distribution caused by the density difference between hydrogen and natural gas will result in the fluctuations of local hydrogen partial pressure, which may exceed the set one, leading to pipeline failure, leakage, measurement error, and terminal appliance. To solve the problem, the H2–CH4 stratification in the horizontal and undulated pipe was investigated experimentally and with numerical simulations. The results show that in the gas stagnant situation, hydrogen-methane blending process will cause an obvious stratification phenomenon. The relations between the elevation, pressure, hydrogen fraction, etc., and the gas stratification are figured out. Moreover, even when the blended gas flows at a low rate, the hydrogen-caused stratification should also be considered. Thereafter, the blended gas should be controlled into a situation with low pressure and high speed, which could help to set the pressure, speed, the fraction of H2.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'International Journal of Hydrogen Energy', 'year': '2023', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.4324/9780429426537-9', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.4324/9780429426537-9', 'title': 'Mobility from/to/within\xa0Europe', 'abstract': '', 'authors': ['James Wickham'], 'journal': 'European Societies Today', 'year': '2020', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.5455/kpd.26024438m000087', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.5455/kpd.26024438m000087', 'title': 'COVID-19 Pandemisinin Sosyal Medya Ba""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""ml""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""l""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""na Etkisi: ""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""niversite ""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""-""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""rencilerinde Bir ""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""nceleme', 'abstract': '', 'authors': ['Kuntay Arcan'], 'journal': 'Klinik Psikoloji Dergisi', 'year': '2022', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}]","{'10.4236/als.2022.102018': {'authors': ['Zhiling Wu', 'Li Wei'], 'title': 'A Study on Symbolic Connotations and Metaphorical Implications in &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The Color Purple&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;'}, '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.04.137': {'authors': [], 'title': 'An empirical study on intention to use hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in India '}, '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.12.064': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Technoeconomic and environmental assessment of HyForce, a hydrogen-fuelled harbour tug '}, '10.1016/j.atmosenv.2006.10.023': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Air pollution reduction via use of green energy sources for electricity and hydrogen production '}, '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2005.11.002': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Hydrogen enrichment effects on the second law analysis of natural and landfill gas combustion in engine cylinders '}, '10.1016/j.seta.2022.102762': {'authors': [], 'title': 'A review of low and zero carbon fuel technologies: Achieving ship carbon reduction targets '}, '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.05.217': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Towards the Hydrogen Economy in Paraguay: Green hydrogen production potential and end-uses '}, '10.1016/0360-3199(84)90191-5': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Method of removing hydrogen sulfide from gases utilizing a polyvalent metal chelate solution and regenerating the solution in a fuel cell '}, '10.1016/s2542-5196(21)00201-1': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Air pollution and development in Africa: impacts on health, the economy, and human capital '}, '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.11.074': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Study on the stratification of the blended gas in the pipeline with hydrogen into natural gas '}, '10.4324/9780429426537-9': {'authors': ['James Wickham'], 'title': 'Mobility from/to/within\xa0Europe'}, '10.5455/kpd.26024438m000087': {'authors': ['Kuntay Arcan'], 'title': 'COVID-19 Pandemisinin Sosyal Medya Ba""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""ml""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""l""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""na Etkisi: ""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""niversite ""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""-""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""rencilerinde Bir ""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""""&amp;#"".ord($0)."";""nceleme'}}"

Africa has been identified as a potential key player in the production of green hydrogen not only for itself but also for other countries in Europe. There are however several factors that may either positively or negatively affect the development of green hydrogen on the continent. This study identified some opportunities and barriers to the production of green hydrogen in Africa and used the multi-criteria decision-making approach to prioritize them. The study identified the opportunity to export to EU market (20.90%), availability of RE resources (34.88%), youthful population (13.95%), Agenda 2063 (9.30%), and ammonia production (20.90%) as some of the opportunities available on the continent. The availability of RE resources was selected as the highest opportunity for the development of hydrogen energy in Africa. High cost of hydrogen (11.78%), dealing with the status-quo (8.82%), corruption in the energy sector (4.52%), land availability issues (7.06%), political instabilities and insecurity in certain parts of the continent (11.76%), lack of the needed skills and education (11.76%), limited supporting infrastructure and financing (15.38%), and lack of the needed regulatory and legal framework (28.95%) were identified as some of the barriers that could affect the development and use of hydrogen in Africa.

Africa has been identified as a potential key player in the production of green hydrogen not only for itself but also for other countries in Europe. There are however several factors that may either positively or negatively affect the development of green hydrogen on the continent. This study identified some opportunities and barriers to the production of green hydrogen in Africa and used the multi-criteria decision-making approach to prioritize them. The study identified the opportunity to export to EU market (20.90%), availability of RE resources (34.88%), youthful population (13.95%), Agenda 2063 (9.30%), and ammonia production (20.90%) as some of the opportunities available on the continent. The availability of RE resources was selected as the highest opportunity for the development of hydrogen energy in Africa. High cost of hydrogen (11.78%), dealing with the status-quo (8.82%), corruption in the energy sector (4.52%), land availability issues (7.06%), political instabilities and insecurity in certain parts of the continent (11.76%), lack of the needed skills and education (11.76%), limited supporting infrastructure and financing (15.38%), and lack of the needed regulatory and legal framework (28.95%) were identified as some of the barriers that could affect the development and use of hydrogen in Africa. The study recommends regional and country level policies and cooperation among the various blocs in Africa as an important tool to remove barriers that could hinder the deployment of hydrogen energy on the continent.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'International Journal of Hydrogen Energy', 'year': '2024', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}]","{'10.2139/ssrn.4141121': {'authors': ['Samir Mohammed Dawoud'], 'title': 'Market Analysis and Bidding Strategy for the Energy Market of Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems'}, '10.1016/s2213-2600(21)00210-1': {'authors': [], 'title': 'The 2021 USPSTF lung cancer screening guidelines: a new frontier '}, '10.2139/ssrn.4367762': {'authors': ['Robert W.

Hydrogen is globally discussed as a possible future energy carrier and regarded as the urgently needed building block for the much needed carbon-neutral energy transition of hard-to-abate sectors to mitigate the effects of global warming. This article provides synthesised, measurable sustainability criteria for analysing green hydrogen production proposals and strategies. Drawn from expert interviews and an extensive literature review this article proposes that a sustainable hydrogen production should consider six impact categories; Energy transition, Environment, Basic needs, Socio-economy, Electricity supply, and Project planning. The categories are broken down into sixteen measurable sustainability criteria, which are determined with related indicators. The article concludes that low economic costs can never be the only decisive criterion for the hydrogen production; social aspects must be integrated along the entire value chain. The compliance with the criteria may avoid social and ecological injustices in the planning of green hydrogen projects and increases inter alia the social welfare of the affected population.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Smart Energy', 'year': '2023', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}]","{'10.2139/ssrn.4141121': {'authors': ['Samir Mohammed Dawoud'], 'title': 'Market Analysis and Bidding Strategy for the Energy Market of Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems'}, '10.1016/s2213-2600(21)00210-1': {'authors': [], 'title': 'The 2021 USPSTF lung cancer screening guidelines: a new frontier '}, '10.2139/ssrn.4367762': {'authors': ['Robert W.

This study performs a cradle-to-gate social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) of green hydrogen production via water electrolysis powered by renewable electricity from solar photovoltaic and wind farms in seven countries (the US, Chile, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Australia, and China) to identify the social hotspots in the entire value chain. The results of S-LCA indicate that green hydrogen production in South Africa poses the highest risk to most of the social indicators, especially child labor, fair salary, unemployment, association and bargaining rights, and gender wage gap. However, in the other countries, the risk to most of the social indicators drastically reduces when key equipment is manufactured in the country itself rather than when it is imported from other countries. Due to the increased complexity of the green hydrogen supply chain resulting from components sourced from various parts of the world, the S-LCA results indicate that compared with conventional hydrogen, green hydrogen performed poorly in various social indicators.

This article provides synthesised, measurable sustainability criteria for analysing green hydrogen production proposals and strategies. Drawn from expert interviews and an extensive literature review this article proposes that a sustainable hydrogen production should consider six impact categories; Energy transition, Environment, Basic needs, Socio-economy, Electricity supply, and Project planning. The categories are broken down into sixteen measurable sustainability criteria, which are determined with related indicators. The article concludes that low economic costs can never be the only decisive criterion for the hydrogen production; social aspects must be integrated along the entire value chain.

This study performs a cradle-to-gate social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) of green hydrogen production via water electrolysis powered by renewable electricity from solar photovoltaic and wind farms in seven countries (the US, Chile, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Australia, and China) to identify the social hotspots in the entire value chain. The results of S-LCA indicate that green hydrogen production in South Africa poses the highest risk to most of the social indicators, especially child labor, fair salary, unemployment, association and bargaining rights, and gender wage gap. However, in the other countries, the risk to most of the social indicators drastically reduces when key equipment is manufactured in the country itself rather than when it is imported from other countries. Due to the increased complexity of the green hydrogen supply chain resulting from components sourced from various parts of the world, the S-LCA results indicate that compared with conventional hydrogen, green hydrogen performed poorly in various social indicators.

Green hydrogen is a form of hydrogen gas that is produced using renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, through a process called electrolysis. The green hydrogen supply chain includes several interconnected entities such as renewable energy providers, electrolysers, distribution facilities, and consumers. Although there have been many studies about green hydrogen, little attention has been devoted to green hydrogen supply chain risk identification and analysis, especially for hard-to-abate sectors in Europe. This research contributes to existing knowledge by identifying and analysing the European region's green hydrogen supply chain risk factors. Using a Delphi method 7 categories and 43 risk factors are identified based on the green hydrogen supply chain experts' opinions. The best-worst method is utilised to determine the importance weights of the risk categories and risk factors. High investment of capital for hydrogen production and delivery technology was the highest-ranked risk factor followed by the lack of enough capacity for electrolyser, and policy & regulation development. Several mitigation strategies and policy recommendations are proposed for high-importance risk factors. This study provides novelty in the form of an integrated approach resulting in a scientific ranking of the risk factors for the green hydrogen supply chain. The results of this study provide empirical evidence which corroborates with previous studies that European countries should endeavour to create comprehensive and supportive standards and regulations for green hydrogen supply chain implementation.\n               "", 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews', 'year': '2023', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}]","{'10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.136438': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Green hydrogen and sustainable development – A social LCA perspective highlighting social hotspots and geopolitical implications of the future hydrogen economy '}, '10.1111/jiec.12840': {'authors': ['Jasmin Werker', 'Christina Wulf', 'Petra Zapp'], 'title': 'Working conditions in hydrogen production: A social life cycle assessment'}, '10.1016/j.rser.2023.113371': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Green hydrogen supply chain risk analysis: A european hard-to-abate sectors perspective '}}"

If to date, water electrolysis is considered to be a scalable technology, the source of water to enable a “green hydrogen” economy at scale is questionable. Countries with the highest renewable energy potential like Australia, are also among the driest places on earth. Globally 380,000 GL/year of wastewater is available, and this is much more than the 34,500 GL/year of water required to produce the projected 2.3 Gt of hydrogen of a mature hydrogen economy. Hence the need to assess both technically and economically whether some wastewater treatment effluent, are a better source for green hydrogen. Analysis of Sydney Water's wastewater treatment plants alone shows that these plants have 37.6 ML/day of unused tertiary effluents, which if electrolysed would generate 420,000 t H2/day or 0.88 Mt H2/year, and cover ∼100% of Australia's estimated production by 2030. Furthermore, the production of oxygen as a by-product of the electrolysis process could lead to significant benefits to the water industry, not only in reducing the cost of the hydrogen produced for $3/kg (assuming a price of oxygen of $3–4 per kg), but also in improving the environmental footprint of wastewater treatment plants by enabling the onsite re-use of oxygen for the treatment of the wastewater. Compared to desalinated water that requires large investments, or stormwater that is unpredictable, it is apparent that the water utilities have a critical role to play in managing water assets that are “climate independent” as the next “golden oil” opportunity and in enabling a “responsible” hydrogen industry, that sensibly manages its water demands and does not compete with existing water potable water demand.\n               "", 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Energy Nexus', 'year': '2022', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1201/9781003151883-13', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1201/9781003151883-13', 'title': 'Energy Cost Reduction / Going Green', 'abstract': '', 'authors': ['Dale R.

Its adoption will be critical for decarbonizing industrial processes at scale, especially hard-to-abate ones such as steel and cement production. This paper maps the role countries could play in future green hydrogen industrial markets based on three criteria: resource endowment, existing industrial production, and economic relatedness. Our analysis shows how the potential for green hydrogen production and leadership in industrial applications is distributed unequally around the globe. Countries like the United States and China could emerge as frontrunners in future green hydrogen markets and lead in industrial applications, such as ammonia, methanol, and steel production. Other resource-rich countries could upgrade along value chains and compete with import-dependent industrial powers for jobs and market shares.

Due to the still growing domestic oil and coal industry, the use of green hydrogen in the country currently seems unlikely at the higher costs of hydrogen as an energy vector. However, the export of green hydrogen to industrialized countries could be an option. In 2020, a hydrogen partnership has been established between Germany and Niger. The potential import of green hydrogen represents an option for Germany and other European countries to decarbonize domestic energy supply. Currently there are no known projects for the electrolytic production of hydrogen in Niger. In this work, potential hydrogen demand across electricity and transport sectors is forecasted until 2040. The electricity demand in 2040 is expected at 2934\xa0GWh and the gasoline and diesel demand at 964\xa0m3 and 2181\xa0m3 respectively. Accordingly, the total hydrogen needed to supply electricity and the transport sector (e.g. to replace 1% gasoline and diesel demand in 2040) is calculated at 0.0117\xa0Mt.

Here, ground-level measurements of spectral irradiance collected worldwide have been pooled to provide a sampling of geographic, seasonal, and diurnal variation. Applied to nine solar cell types, the resulting divergence in solar cell efficiencies illustrates that a single spectrum is insufficient for comparisons of cells with different spectral responses. Cells with two or more junctions tend to have efficiencies below that under the standard spectrum.

Even though water is an important aspect of the environmental impact, the impact assessment of hydrogen production on water is lacking. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for assessing the water footprints of hydrogen production from electrolysis. A major innovative aspect is to demonstrate the geographical distribution of the footprints along the supply chain. The water footprints for hydrogen produced from grid electricity, wind and solar power in Australia was analysed as a case study. Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the influence of key parameters including Solar Radiation Level, Silicon Efficiency, and Lifetime of PV Modules. The study finds that the water consumption footprint is much less than that reported in the literature and large part of the water could be consumed indirectly outside of hydrogen producing countries. The quantity of water footprint varies significantly among different assumptions. The findings provide insights into both domestic and cross-boundary water impacts of hydrogen electrolysis and can thus inform policy debates in each nation and beyond.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Renewable Energy', 'year': '2020', 'pdf_url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148120303487', 'pdf_source': 'unpaywall', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'request_failed', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.renene.2020.03', 'doi_repaired': '10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.037', 'repair_note': 'repaired_by_elsevier_j_stem:10.1016/j.renene.2020.03', 'doi': '10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.037', 'title': 'Effects of hydrogen addition on the laminar methanol-air flame under different initial temperatures ', 'abstract': '\n                  Methanol has been regarded as a promising alternative fuel.

Effects of blending hydrogen on the laminar flames of methanol under changing initial temperatures was then investigated. The experiments were undertaken in a constant volume chamber.

Portugal's strategy for H2 sets public policies promoting an industry focused on the hydrogen value chain. Considering the production of green hydrogen from renewable sources is key, water electrolysis becomes a priority, and with it, the need to assess the suitability of water sources, which is determined by both quantitative and qualitative factors. This work presents a new approach to assess the suitability of water sources for hydrogen production via water electrolysis by applying a Sustainable Value Methodology for decision-making support, combining economic, environmental and social criteria. The approach is applied to two different sites in Portugal: a semi-urban location on the Atlantic coast (site A) and a rural area far from the coast (site B). For both sites, water sources are evaluated regarding water availability, quality, transport options, abstraction costs, treatment needs and regulation (including environmental constraints) and social acceptance. The resulting sustainable value indicator, aggregator of different levels of information, enables a relative quantitative comparison of the performance of different water sources for electrolysis and the involved costs. It is found that the public grid water is the most suited source of water for electrolysis due to lower risk of supply, lower costs and avoids complex permitting processes. Likewise, seawater and wastewater treatment plant effluent (only in site A) showed to be possible water sources where the factors most affecting suitability are transport costs for water and waste disposal from water treatment.\n               "", 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Journal of Cleaner Production', 'year': '2021', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.rser.2022.112705', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1016/j.rser.2022.112705', 'title': 'Renewable hydrogen economy outlook in Africa ', 'abstract': '\n                  Hydrogen presents an opportunity for Africa to not only decarbonise its own energy use and enable clean energy access for all, but also to export renewable energy. This paper developed a framework for assessing renewable resources for hydrogen production and provides a new critical analysis as to how and what role hydrogen can play in the complex African energy landscape. The regional solar, wind, CSP, and bio hydrogen potential ranges from 366 to 1311\xa0Gt/year, 162 to 1782\xa0Gt/year, 463 to 2738\xa0Gt/year, and 0.03 to 0.06\xa0Gt/year respectively. The water availability and sensitivity results showed that the water shortages in some countries can be abated by importing water from regions with high renewable water resources. A techno-economic comparative analysis indicated that a high voltage direct current (HVDC) system presents the most cost-effective transportation system with overall costs per kg hydrogen of 0.038 $/kg, followed by water pipeline with 0.084 $/kg, seawater desalination 0.1 $/kg, liquified hydrogen tank truck 0.12 $/kg, compressed hydrogen pipeline 0.16 $/kg, liquefied ammonia pipeline 0.38 $/kg, liquefied ammonia tank truck 0.60 $/kg, and compressed hydrogen tank truck with 0.77 $/kg. The results quantified the significance of economies of scale due to cost effectiveness of systems such as compressed hydrogen pipeline and liquefied hydrogen tank truck systems when hydrogen production is scaled up. Decentralization is favorable under some constraints, e.g., compressed hydrogen and liquefied ammonia tank truck systems will be more cost effective below 800\xa0km and 1400\xa0km due to lower investment and operation costs.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews', 'year': '2022', 'pdf_url': 'https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1364032122005949-ga1_lrg.jpg', 'pdf_source': 'unpaywall', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'not_pdf_ct:image/jpeg', 'status': 'ok'}]","{'10.1016/j.renene.2022.07.052': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Green hydrogen production potential in West Africa – Case of Niger '}, '10.1016/j.renene.2022.07.011': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Impact of measured spectrum variation on solar photovoltaic efficiencies worldwide '}, '10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.026': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Quantification of fresh water consumption and scarcity footprints of hydrogen from water electrolysis: A methodology framework '}, '10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.037': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Effects of hydrogen addition on the laminar methanol-air flame under different initial temperatures '}, '10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128124': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Water availability and water usage solutions for electrolysis in hydrogen production '}, '10.1016/j.rser.2022.112705': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Renewable hydrogen economy outlook in Africa '}}"

Portugal's strategy for H2 sets public policies promoting an industry focused on the hydrogen value chain. Considering the production of green hydrogen from renewable sources is key, water electrolysis becomes a priority, and with it, the need to assess the suitability of water sources, which is determined by both quantitative and qualitative factors. This work presents a new approach to assess the suitability of water sources for hydrogen production via water electrolysis by applying a Sustainable Value Methodology for decision-making support, combining economic, environmental and social criteria. The approach is applied to two different sites in Portugal: a semi-urban location on the Atlantic coast (site A) and a rural area far from the coast (site B). For both sites, water sources are evaluated regarding water availability, quality, transport options, abstraction costs, treatment needs and regulation (including environmental constraints) and social acceptance. The resulting sustainable value indicator, aggregator of different levels of information, enables a relative quantitative comparison of the performance of different water sources for electrolysis and the involved costs. It is found that the public grid water is the most suited source of water for electrolysis due to lower risk of supply, lower costs and avoids complex permitting processes. Likewise, seawater and wastewater treatment plant effluent (only in site A) showed to be possible water sources where the factors most affecting suitability are transport costs for water and waste disposal from water treatment.\n               "", 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Journal of Cleaner Production', 'year': '2021', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.026', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.026', 'title': 'Quantification of fresh water consumption and scarcity footprints of hydrogen from water electrolysis: A methodology framework ', 'abstract': '\n                  Towards decarbonizing the global economy, hydrogen produced through water electrolysis is expected to be one of the key solutions for variable renewable energy storage and sector coupling, in particular, via the transport sector in the next few decades. Even though water is an important aspect of the environmental impact, the impact assessment of hydrogen production on water is lacking. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for assessing the water footprints of hydrogen production from electrolysis. A major innovative aspect is to demonstrate the geographical distribution of the footprints along the supply chain. The water footprints for hydrogen produced from grid electricity, wind and solar power in Australia was analysed as a case study. Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the influence of key parameters including Solar Radiation Level, Silicon Efficiency, and Lifetime of PV Modules. The study finds that the water consumption footprint is much less than that reported in the literature and large part of the water could be consumed indirectly outside of hydrogen producing countries. The quantity of water footprint varies significantly among different assumptions. The findings provide insights into both domestic and cross-boundary water impacts of hydrogen electrolysis and can thus inform policy debates in each nation and beyond.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Renewable Energy', 'year': '2020', 'pdf_url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148120303487', 'pdf_source': 'unpaywall', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'request_failed', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.renene.2020.03', 'doi_repaired': '10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124099', 'repair_note': 'repaired_by_elsevier_j_stem:10.1016/j.renene.2020.03', 'doi': '10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124099', 'title': 'Coupling pesticide emission and toxicity characterization models for LCA: Application to open-field tomato production in Martinique ', 'abstract': '\n                  The environmental evaluation of fruits and vegetables in life cycle assessment (LCA) requires a proper estimation of pesticide emissions and associated (eco-)toxicity impacts. In response, we developed an approach to consistently combine state-of-the-art emission inventory and impact assessment models for assessing human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity impacts from pesticide applications, and tested our approach in an LCA case study on pesticides applied to an open-field tomato produced in Martinique (French West Indies). Our results show that impact scores vary over several orders of magnitude, mainly as function of differences in pesticide properties and application time in relation to crop growth stage. Overall, impacts related to pesticide field emissions leading to exposure to pesticide residues in crop harvest are a main contributor to LCA performance results for tomato produced in Martinique, with fertilizer and packaging manufacturing as other dominating aspects. While the proposed approach is applicable to refine currently LCA methods for assessing pesticides, large uncertainties remain. These are mostly related to the parametrization of impact factors for tropical species. Based on our findings, we recommend using initial emission distribution fractions in combination with steady-state characterization factors for environmental emissions and with time-dependent characterization factors for pesticide residues in crop harvest in LCA, while further improving the use of secondary emission fractions to allow for better consideration of local field, soil and climate characteristics.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Journal of Cleaner Production', 'year': '2020', 'pdf_url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0959652620341445?via%3Dihub', 'pdf_source': 'unpaywall', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'request_failed', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.04.012', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.04.012', 'title': 'Hydrogen strategy in decarbonization era: Egypt as a case study ', 'abstract': ""\n                  The quest for a low-carbon energy transition has grown in recent years as concerns about the effects of climate change have grown.

From a global climate change mitigation point of view exploiting such efficiencies can be profitable, since they reduce overall renewable electricity capacity requirements. Yet the construction of this capacity in North Africa would imply costs associated with the infrastructure needed to transport electricity and hydrogen. The ensuing geopolitical dependencies may also raise energy security concerns. With the integrated assessment model TIAM-ECN we quantify the trade-off between costs and benefits emanating from establishing import-export links between Europe and North Africa for electricity and hydrogen. We show that for Europe a net price may have to be paid for exploiting such interlinkages, even while they reduce the domestic investments for renewable electricity capacity needed to implement the EU's Green Deal. For North African countries the potential net benefits thanks to trade revenues may build up to 50 billion €/yr in 2050. Despite fears over costs and security, Europe should seriously consider an energy partnership with North Africa, because trade revenues are likely to lead to positive employment, income, and stability effects in North Africa.

From a global climate change mitigation point of view exploiting such efficiencies can be profitable, since they reduce overall renewable electricity capacity requirements. Yet the construction of this capacity in North Africa would imply costs associated with the infrastructure needed to transport electricity and hydrogen. The ensuing geopolitical dependencies may also raise energy security concerns. With the integrated assessment model TIAM-ECN we quantify the trade-off between costs and benefits emanating from establishing import-export links between Europe and North Africa for electricity and hydrogen. We show that for Europe a net price may have to be paid for exploiting such interlinkages, even while they reduce the domestic investments for renewable electricity capacity needed to implement the EU's Green Deal. For North African countries the potential net benefits thanks to trade revenues may build up to 50 billion €/yr in 2050. Despite fears over costs and security, Europe should seriously consider an energy partnership with North Africa, because trade revenues are likely to lead to positive employment, income, and stability effects in North Africa. Europe can indirectly benefit from such impacts.\n               "", 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Energy Policy', 'year': '2021', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}]","{'10.2139/ssrn.4141121': {'authors': ['Samir Mohammed Dawoud'], 'title': 'Market Analysis and Bidding Strategy for the Energy Market of Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems'}, '10.37256/ges.3220221290': {'authors': ['Falendra Kumar Sudan'], 'title': ""Indo-Pacific Strategy and India's Opportunities and Challenges for  Regional Economic Cooperation and Integration: An Exploratory  Review""}, '10.1002/cind.866_2.x': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Renewables booming'}, '10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112613': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Timmermans’ dream: An electricity and hydrogen partnership between Europe and North Africa '}}"

Focusing on the energetic and techno-economic assessment of potential green supply chains, this study investigates the direct reduced iron-electric arc furnace production route enabled by renewable energy and deployed in regional settings. The hypothesis, that co-locating manufacturing processes with renewable energy resources would offer highest energy efficiency and cost reduction, is tested through an Australia-Japan case study. The binational partnership is structured to meet Japanese steel demand (for domestic use and regional exports) and source both energy and iron ore from the Pilbara region of Western Australia. A total of 12 unique supply chains differentiated by spatial configuration, timeline and energy carrier were simulated, which validated the hypothesis: direct energy and ore exports to remote steel producers (i.e. Japan-based production), as opposed to co-locating iron and steel production with abundant ore and renewable energy resources (i.e. Australia-based production), increased energy consumption and the levelised cost of steel by 45% and 32%, respectively, when averaged across 2030 and 2050. Two decades of technological development and economies of scale realisation would be crucial; 2030 supply chains were on average 12% more energy-intense and 23% more expensive than 2050 equivalents. On energy vectors, liquefied hydrogen was more efficient than ammonia for export-dominant supply chains due to the pairing of its process flexibility and the intermittent solar energy profile, as well as the avoidance of the need for ammonia cracking prior to direct reduction. To mitigate the green premium, a carbon tax in the range of A$66–192/t CO2 would be required in 2030 and A$0–70/t CO2 in 2050; the diminished carbon tax requirement in the latter is achievable only by wholly Australia-based production. Further, the modelled system scale was immense; producing 40 Mtpa of decarbonised steel will require 74–129% of Australia’s current electricity output and A$137–328 billion in capital investment for solar power, production, and shipping vessel infrastructure. These results call for strategic planning of regional resource pairing to drive energy and cost efficiencies which accelerate the global decarbonisation of steel.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Energy Conversion and Management', 'year': '2022', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1201/9781003151883-13', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1201/9781003151883-13', 'title': 'Energy Cost Reduction / Going Green', 'abstract': '', 'authors': ['Dale R.

We use hourly data in four locations with world-class solar in the Atacama desert and wind in Patagonia steppes. We find that hybridization of wind and solar can reduce hydrogen production costs by a few percents, when the effect of increasing the load factor on the electrolyser overweighs the electricity cost increase. For ammonia production, the gains by hybridization can be substantially larger, because it reduces the power variability, which is costly, due to the need for intermediate storage of hydrogen between the flexible electrolyser and the less flexible ammonia synthesis unit. Our modelling reveals the crucial role in the synthesis of flexibility, which cuts the cost of variability, especially for the more variable wind power. Our estimated near-term production costs for green hydrogen, around 2 USD/kg, and green ammonia, below 500 USD/t, are encouragingly close to competitiveness against fossil-fuel alternatives.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'International Journal of Hydrogen Energy', 'year': '2020', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.11', 'doi_repaired': '10.3390/su11102984', 'repair_note': 'repaired_by_elsevier_j_stem:10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.11', 'doi': '10.3390/su11102984', 'title': 'The Millennials’ Concept of Sustainability in the Food Sector', 'abstract': '', 'authors': ['Luigi Bollani', 'Alessandro Bonadonna', 'Giovanni Peira'], 'journal': 'Sustainability', 'year': '2019', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.rser.2022.112381', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1016/j.rser.2022.112381', 'title': 'Green ammonia enables sustainable energy production in small island developing states: A case study on the island of Curaçao ', 'abstract': '\n                  Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have a high dependency on fossil fuels for energy, water, and food production. This has negative implications on the carbon footprint and resilience of the SIDS. Wind power is one of the most promising options for renewable energy in the coastal areas of the SIDS. To account for the seasonal intermittent nature of wind energy, ammonia can be used for energy storage. In this paper, ammonia as an energy vector, is examined to reduce the costs and carbon footprint of energy on the island of Curaçao as a showcase for Caribbean SIDS. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for the combined wind and ammonia energy storage system is 0.13 USD/kWh at a discount rate of 5%. This is cost competitive with the LCOE of 0.15–0.17 USD/kWh from heavy fuel oil, which is the main electricity source in the Caribbean SIDS. In Curaçao, the LCOE from LNG and coal without carbon capture and storage (CCS) is 0.07–0.10 USD/kWh and 0.09–0.14 USD/kWh, respectively. When CCS is applied, the LCOE from LNG and coal is 0.10–0.13 USD/kWh and 0.14–0.21 USD/kWh, respectively. This suggests that the LCOE of the combined wind and ammonia energy storage system can be competitive with fossil-based alternatives with carbon capture and storage (CCS) in a decarbonized energy landscape. The CO2-footprint of the combined wind energy and ammonia energy storage system is 0.03\xa0kg CO2/kWh, compared to 0.04\xa0kg CO2/kWh and 0.12\xa0kg CO2/kWh for LNG-/coal-based energy generation with CCS, respectively.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews', 'year': '2022', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.erss.2022.102847', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1016/j.erss.2022.102847', 'title': 'Green hydrogen value chains in the industrial sector—Geopolitical and market implications ', 'abstract': '\n                  The global transition to a low-carbon economy will significantly impact existing energy value chains and transform the production to consumption lifecycle, dramatically altering interactions among stakeholders. Thanks to its versatility, green hydrogen could play a significant role in reaching a carbon-free future by 2050. Its adoption will be critical for decarbonizing industrial processes at scale, especially hard-to-abate ones such as steel and cement production. This paper maps the role countries could play in future green hydrogen industrial markets based on three criteria: resource endowment, existing industrial production, and economic relatedness. Our analysis shows how the potential for green hydrogen production and leadership in industrial applications is distributed unequally around the globe. Countries like the United States and China could emerge as frontrunners in future green hydrogen markets and lead in industrial applications, such as ammonia, methanol, and steel production. Other resource-rich countries could upgrade along value chains and compete with import-dependent industrial powers for jobs and market shares. A transition in existing value chains will also give rise to new market and geopolitical dynamics and dependencies.

This study performs a cradle-to-gate social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) of green hydrogen production via water electrolysis powered by renewable electricity from solar photovoltaic and wind farms in seven countries (the US, Chile, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Australia, and China) to identify the social hotspots in the entire value chain. The results of S-LCA indicate that green hydrogen production in South Africa poses the highest risk to most of the social indicators, especially child labor, fair salary, unemployment, association and bargaining rights, and gender wage gap. However, in the other countries, the risk to most of the social indicators drastically reduces when key equipment is manufactured in the country itself rather than when it is imported from other countries. Due to the increased complexity of the green hydrogen supply chain resulting from components sourced from various parts of the world, the S-LCA results indicate that compared with conventional hydrogen, green hydrogen performed poorly in various social indicators. The S-LCA results revealed that outsourcing key equipment from developing countries with poor working conditions is a major social hotspot in the sustainable development of these countries. In addition, the S-LCA results demonstrate that the hydrogen economy has the potential to be capable of achieving SDGS by developing a domestic green hydrogen supply chain and enhancing working conditions in country-specific sectors. Furthermore, a holistic discussion of socio-geopolitical implications is presented, emphasizing the need to develop standardized international regulations to prevent colonialism in the future hydrogen economy.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Journal of Cleaner Production', 'year': '2023', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1007/978-981-33-4830-1_17', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1007/978-981-33-4830-1_17', 'title': 'Renewable Energy in India: What It Means for the Economy and Jobs', 'abstract': '', 'authors': ['Meeta Keswani Mehra', 'Saptarshi Mukherjee', 'Gaurav Bhattacharya', 'Sk.

Multiple studies regarding users' attitudes, intentions, and behavior have been done towards electric vehicles in India, but none so far on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs). Our purpose is to inquire about the key parameters influencing the intention to use HFCVs in India. This empirical research using an online questionnaire was distributed and responses of 483 prospective customers received. To ascertain the users' intentions toward HFCVs, we applied a structural equation modelling approach through Smart-PLS 3.0. We find that perceived benefit, perceived risk, and policy interventions significantly influence the users' intention to adopt HFCV in India.

Fossil fuels should be replaced by a system capable of storing massive amounts of electricity and fuels.

The results of S-LCA indicate that green hydrogen production in South Africa poses the highest risk to most of the social indicators, especially child labor, fair salary, unemployment, association and bargaining rights, and gender wage gap. However, in the other countries, the risk to most of the social indicators drastically reduces when key equipment is manufactured in the country itself rather than when it is imported from other countries. Due to the increased complexity of the green hydrogen supply chain resulting from components sourced from various parts of the world, the S-LCA results indicate that compared with conventional hydrogen, green hydrogen performed poorly in various social indicators. The S-LCA results revealed that outsourcing key equipment from developing countries with poor working conditions is a major social hotspot in the sustainable development of these countries. In addition, the S-LCA results demonstrate that the hydrogen economy has the potential to be capable of achieving SDGS by developing a domestic green hydrogen supply chain and enhancing working conditions in country-specific sectors.

Focusing on the energetic and techno-economic assessment of potential green supply chains, this study investigates the direct reduced iron-electric arc furnace production route enabled by renewable energy and deployed in regional settings. The hypothesis, that co-locating manufacturing processes with renewable energy resources would offer highest energy efficiency and cost reduction, is tested through an Australia-Japan case study. The binational partnership is structured to meet Japanese steel demand (for domestic use and regional exports) and source both energy and iron ore from the Pilbara region of Western Australia. A total of 12 unique supply chains differentiated by spatial configuration, timeline and energy carrier were simulated, which validated the hypothesis: direct energy and ore exports to remote steel producers (i.e. Japan-based production), as opposed to co-locating iron and steel production with abundant ore and renewable energy resources (i.e. Australia-based production), increased energy consumption and the levelised cost of steel by 45% and 32%, respectively, when averaged across 2030 and 2050. Two decades of technological development and economies of scale realisation would be crucial; 2030 supply chains were on average 12% more energy-intense and 23% more expensive than 2050 equivalents. On energy vectors, liquefied hydrogen was more efficient than ammonia for export-dominant supply chains due to the pairing of its process flexibility and the intermittent solar energy profile, as well as the avoidance of the need for ammonia cracking prior to direct reduction. To mitigate the green premium, a carbon tax in the range of A$66–192/t CO2 would be required in 2030 and A$0–70/t CO2 in 2050; the diminished carbon tax requirement in the latter is achievable only by wholly Australia-based production. Further, the modelled system scale was immense; producing 40 Mtpa of decarbonised steel will require 74–129% of Australia’s current electricity output and A$137–328 billion in capital investment for solar power, production, and shipping vessel infrastructure. These results call for strategic planning of regional resource pairing to drive energy and cost efficiencies which accelerate the global decarbonisation of steel.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Energy Conversion and Management', 'year': '2022', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.3390/su132413681', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.3390/su132413681', 'title': 'Green Hydrogen Value Chain in the Sustainability for Port Operations: Case Study in the Region of Valparaiso, Chile', 'abstract': '', 'authors': ['Yunesky Masip Macía', 'Pablo Rodríguez Machuca', 'Angel Alexander Rodríguez Soto', 'Roberto Carmona Campos'], 'journal': 'Sustainability', 'year': '2021', 'pdf_url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/24/13681/pdf?version=1639386435', 'pdf_source': 'unpaywall', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'request_failed', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.erss.2020.101667', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1016/j.erss.2020.101667', 'title': 'The new oil?

The technologies and infrastructures underpinning a hydrogen economy can take markedly different forms, and the choice over which pathway to take is the object of competition between different stakeholders and countries. Over time, cross-border maritime trade in hydrogen has the potential to fundamentally redraw the geography of global energy trade, create a new class of energy exporters, and reshape geopolitical relations and alliances between countries.

Green hydrogen is considered a potential candidate for fossil fuel soon—however, hydrogen is facing the challenges of storage and transportation. Green ammonia, with its ease of transport and storage, is another promising alternative. Decarbonizing ammonia production is an environmental press toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. This work summarizes the up-to-date progress in the green ammonia production methods. An assessment of the different production methods was conducted to highlight the merits and constraints of each approach. Moreover, the promising applications of green ammonia in the energy sectors were discussed. The various barriers, i.e., technical, economic, environmental, and regulations and policies, facing the widespread of green ammonia were also discussed. Finally, the contribution of green ammonia in achieving the different sustainable development goals was elaborated, focusing on the contribution of green ammonia in achieving climate change (SDG 13), clean energy (SDG 7), and other sustainability-related goals. Low efficiencies, high cost, and negative environmental impacts are the common challenges of the various production methods. The progress in green ammonia is essential for achieving SDG2, “Zero hunger”. SDG3 “healthy life and well-being” and SDG13 “Climate action”, will be achieved by eliminating 3.85\xa0kg CO2-eq/kg NH3 emitted from conventional ammonia-based processes. Ease storing of green ammonia in liquid form (at 9\xa0bar or cooling to −33°); makes it the best green energy source, i.e., achieving SDG7 “green and affordable energy”. By2050, green ammonia is expected to represent 99\xa0% of marine fuel, thus contributing to SDG9 “Industry and Infrastructure”. Moreover, green ammonia production will save 35.2 GJ of natural gas, thus achieving SDG12 “Responsible consumption/production”.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Energy Conversion and Management', 'year': '2023', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1039/d1se00839k', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1039/d1se00839k', 'title': 'Redox flow batteries: a new frontier on energy storage', 'abstract': '', 'authors': ['P.

The technological scheme of green hydrogen production that is the most optimal for the Russian Federation has been determined. It is shown that by 2040, the net present value of hydrogen production units by the alkaline electrolysis method will amount to US $ 35 thousand/ kW while the cost of plants with a solid polymer or a solid-oxide electrolyzer will be at US$30 thousand/ kW and US $ 26 thousand/ kW accordingly. This paper presents a feasibility study of green hydrogen production from wind-powered electrolysis with further direct reduction of iron ore for green steel manufacturing. According to the analysis, the difference in cash flows between standard steelmaking technology and direct reduction of iron ore with hydrogen is 20% which in the long term could be reduced to 5%. Compared to the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, companies will be able to save about 3% of the present value. To achieve the commercial attractiveness of hydrogen production by electrolysis, the minimum amount of government subsidies should be at least 10% of capital expenditures from 2021 with a gradual increase to 20% by 2040 to support the emerging market.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Environmental Technology & Innovation', 'year': '2022', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115268', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115268', 'title': 'Regional supply chains for decarbonising steel: Energy efficiency and green premium mitigation ', 'abstract': '\n                  Decarbonised steel, enabled by green hydrogen-based iron ore reduction and renewable electricity-based steel making, will disrupt the traditional supply chain. Focusing on the energetic and techno-economic assessment of potential green supply chains, this study investigates the direct reduced iron-electric arc furnace production route enabled by renewable energy and deployed in regional settings. The hypothesis, that co-locating manufacturing processes with renewable energy resources would offer highest energy efficiency and cost reduction, is tested through an Australia-Japan case study. The binational partnership is structured to meet Japanese steel demand (for domestic use and regional exports) and source both energy and iron ore from the Pilbara region of Western Australia. A total of 12 unique supply chains differentiated by spatial configuration, timeline and energy carrier were simulated, which validated the hypothesis: direct energy and ore exports to remote steel producers (i.e. Japan-based production), as opposed to co-locating iron and steel production with abundant ore and renewable energy resources (i.e. Australia-based production), increased energy consumption and the levelised cost of steel by 45% and 32%, respectively, when averaged across 2030 and 2050. Two decades of technological development and economies of scale realisation would be crucial; 2030 supply chains were on average 12% more energy-intense and 23% more expensive than 2050 equivalents. On energy vectors, liquefied hydrogen was more efficient than ammonia for export-dominant supply chains due to the pairing of its process flexibility and the intermittent solar energy profile, as well as the avoidance of the need for ammonia cracking prior to direct reduction. To mitigate the green premium, a carbon tax in the range of A$66–192/t CO2 would be required in 2030 and A$0–70/t CO2 in 2050; the diminished carbon tax requirement in the latter is achievable only by wholly Australia-based production. Further, the modelled system scale was immense; producing 40 Mtpa of decarbonised steel will require 74–129% of Australia’s current electricity output and A$137–328 billion in capital investment for solar power, production, and shipping vessel infrastructure. These results call for strategic planning of regional resource pairing to drive energy and cost efficiencies which accelerate the global decarbonisation of steel.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Energy Conversion and Management', 'year': '2022', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}]","{'10.1016/j.eti.2022.102517': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Development of electrolysis technologies for hydrogen production: A case study of green steel manufacturing in the Russian Federation '}, '10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115268': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Regional supply chains for decarbonising steel: Energy efficiency and green premium mitigation '}}"

Green hydrogen is a form of hydrogen gas that is produced using renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, through a process called electrolysis. The green hydrogen supply chain includes several interconnected entities such as renewable energy providers, electrolysers, distribution facilities, and consumers. Although there have been many studies about green hydrogen, little attention has been devoted to green hydrogen supply chain risk identification and analysis, especially for hard-to-abate sectors in Europe. This research contributes to existing knowledge by identifying and analysing the European region's green hydrogen supply chain risk factors. Using a Delphi method 7 categories and 43 risk factors are identified based on the green hydrogen supply chain experts' opinions. The best-worst method is utilised to determine the importance weights of the risk categories and risk factors. High investment of capital for hydrogen production and delivery technology was the highest-ranked risk factor followed by the lack of enough capacity for electrolyser, and policy & regulation development.

Over the past century, vehicular passenger transport has experienced hypergrowth in terms of task, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. For a variety of reasons, future decades may well see a significantly reduced global passenger transport task, as well as a widespread phasing-out of internal combustion engine vehicles, especially in cities. In contrast, the global freight transport task is unlikely to decline much, and could even grow, so that freight transport will dominate total transport energy use. Even if the world does finally respond seriously to climate change, likely policies will not favour hydrogen for private passenger vehicles for many decades. Nevertheless, hydrogen has clear superiority over electric vehicles for heavy freight transport.

One of the main challenges for cities in terms of transport is to change the transport behaviour of their inhabitants towards a sustainable approach to urban mobility and transport planning. This approach is best ensured by public transport which responds to environmental challenges by using low-emission vehicles for transport. In this aspect, the aim of the article is to present analyses related to the use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel in public transport systems. The method of hydrogen extraction and its use in the public transport systems consists of: the concept of hydrogen extraction, the different approaches of electricity extraction for hydrogen production, and the measures for evaluating the cost of hydrogen extraction and its impact on vehicle operating costs. In addition, this allows for the performance of the analyses of the operating costs of low-emission public transport vehicles fuelled by hydrogen, the production of which uses electricity from renewable sources. The presented method allows public transport companies to carry out analyses in this aspect, which are useful in developing strategies for the development of public transport systems. The applicability of the method was examined on the example of a public transport company, for which analyses were carried out on different fleet investment solutions.

To ascertain the users' intentions toward HFCVs, we applied a structural equation modelling approach through Smart-PLS 3.0. We find that perceived benefit, perceived risk, and policy interventions significantly influence the users' intention to adopt HFCV in India. The study suggests that the government must bring together the stakeholders, including automobile manufacturers, hydrogen producers, research institutions, and funding institutions, to address the bottlenecks to fast-track the hydrogen mobility system.\n               "", 'authors': [], 'journal': 'International Journal of Hydrogen Energy', 'year': '2022', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.11', 'doi_repaired': '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.12.054', 'repair_note': 'repaired_by_elsevier_j_stem:10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.11', 'doi': '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.12.054', 'title': 'Helical confinement effects on hydrogen storage in double-walled carbon nanotubes ', 'abstract': '\n                  Molecular configurations are some of the important factors that strongly affect the hydrogen adsorption in carbon nanotubes (CNTs).

The main idea is to create a hydrogen map for every district in Istanbul, based on renewable energy sources and water splitting technology. The potentially available renewable sources, such as solar (including offshore), wind (including offshore), biomass, geothermal and underwater current are used for calculating the total hydrogen production potential. Istanbul's potential for producing green hydrogen is estimated to be 7.96 Mt. The study results show that Catalca, Şile, Silivri, Arnavutköy, and Beykoz come out as the districts with the highest green hydrogen potential with 1.49 Mt, 1.19 Mt, 1.12 Mt, 0.57 Mt, and 0.46 Mt, respectively. After supplying the necessary power demand for the city, the remaining power is used to produce green hydrogen which may contribute an economic value of over US $100 billion with a current price of $13/kg of hydrogen and 23.88 billion US$ with a targeted price of $3/kg of hydrogen, respectively. The available potentials for each district are also specifically studied and discussed. It is more importantly expected to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by about 90% which will ve very important to achieve a carbon-neutral city and hence country due its dominated role. Furthermore, the results provide a clear guidance to enable policymakers and private sectors to use renewable energy potentials for their investment purposes or promote clean energy programs, tackling carbon-based energy consumption, pollution, and greenhouse effect. This, later on, can be used by policymakers and energy providers to help the city and local communities for achieving the United Nation's sustainable development goals.\n               "", 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Sustainable Cities and Society', 'year': '2022', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.enpol.2022.113015', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1016/j.enpol.2022.113015', 'title': 'Development of a sustainable hydrogen city concept and initial hydrogen city projects ', 'abstract': '\n                  Recently, the concept of sustainable cities has become increasingly important because of serious technical and environmental challenges stemming from global warming.

Green hydrogen is considered a potential candidate for fossil fuel soon—however, hydrogen is facing the challenges of storage and transportation. Green ammonia, with its ease of transport and storage, is another promising alternative. Decarbonizing ammonia production is an environmental press toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. This work summarizes the up-to-date progress in the green ammonia production methods. An assessment of the different production methods was conducted to highlight the merits and constraints of each approach. Moreover, the promising applications of green ammonia in the energy sectors were discussed. The various barriers, i.e., technical, economic, environmental, and regulations and policies, facing the widespread of green ammonia were also discussed. Finally, the contribution of green ammonia in achieving the different sustainable development goals was elaborated, focusing on the contribution of green ammonia in achieving climate change (SDG 13), clean energy (SDG 7), and other sustainability-related goals. Low efficiencies, high cost, and negative environmental impacts are the common challenges of the various production methods. The progress in green ammonia is essential for achieving SDG2, “Zero hunger”. SDG3 “healthy life and well-being” and SDG13 “Climate action”, will be achieved by eliminating 3.85\xa0kg CO2-eq/kg NH3 emitted from conventional ammonia-based processes.

The water availability and sensitivity results showed that the water shortages in some countries can be abated by importing water from regions with high renewable water resources. A techno-economic comparative analysis indicated that a high voltage direct current (HVDC) system presents the most cost-effective transportation system with overall costs per kg hydrogen of 0.038 $/kg, followed by water pipeline with 0.084 $/kg, seawater desalination 0.1 $/kg, liquified hydrogen tank truck 0.12 $/kg, compressed hydrogen pipeline 0.16 $/kg, liquefied ammonia pipeline 0.38 $/kg, liquefied ammonia tank truck 0.60 $/kg, and compressed hydrogen tank truck with 0.77 $/kg. The results quantified the significance of economies of scale due to cost effectiveness of systems such as compressed hydrogen pipeline and liquefied hydrogen tank truck systems when hydrogen production is scaled up.

For hydrogen to have a role in future low-carbon energy systems, it is necessary to demonstrate that it has sufficiently low carbon emissions. This paper explores how green hydrogen has been defined, reviews nascent green hydrogen characterisation initiatives, and highlights the main challenges that standards and guarantee of origin schemes must overcome to develop a market for green hydrogen.\n                  Most existing green hydrogen initiatives are in Europe. In anticipation of a future market for green hydrogen, international standards are starting to be discussed by national and international standardisation organisations and policy makers. A range of approaches have been taken to defining green hydrogen and guarantees of origin. These vary on whether green hydrogen must be produced from renewable energy, on the boundaries of the carbon accounting system, the emission thresholds at which hydrogen is considered green, and on which feedstocks and production technologies are included in the scheme. Decisions on these factors are often influenced by other national and international standards, and the legal framework in which the green hydrogen supply chain operates.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Energy Policy', 'year': '2020', 'pdf_url': 'https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10090386/3/Velazquez%20Abad_GREEN%20HYDROGEN%20CHARACTERISATION%20INITIATIVES%20-%20DEFINITIONS%2C%20STANDARDS%2C%20GUARANTEES%20OF%20ORIGIN%2C%20AND%20CHALLENGES%20-%20Preprint.pdf', 'pdf_source': 'unpaywall', 'pdf_local_path': '/content/downloaded_pdf/10.1016_j.enpol.2020.111300.pdf', 'pdf_save_reason': 'saved', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.18235/0004555', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.18235/0004555', 'title': 'The roadmap for a green hydrogen economy in Trinidad and Tobago', 'abstract': '', 'authors': ['Sharmila Jugessur', 'Qi Xun Low', 'Christiaan Gischler', 'Augusto Bonzi Teixeira', 'Carlton Thomas', 'Tanagna Lessey-Kelly', 'Analeise Ramgattie', 'Marcia Maynard'], 'journal': '', 'year': '2022', 'pdf_url': 'https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The-roadmap-for-a-green-hydrogen-economy-in-Trinidad-and-Tobago.pdf', 'pdf_source': 'unpaywall', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'request_failed', 'status': 'ok'}]","{'10.1016/j.stae.2022.100014': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Sector coupling and business models towards sustainability: The case of the hydrogen vehicle industry '}, '10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111300': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Green hydrogen characterisation initiatives: Definitions, standards, guarantees of origin, and challenges '}, '10.18235/0004555': {'authors': ['Sharmila Jugessur', 'Qi Xun Low', 'Christiaan Gischler', 'Augusto Bonzi Teixeira', 'Carlton Thomas', 'Tanagna Lessey-Kelly', 'Analeise Ramgattie', 'Marcia Maynard'], 'title': 'The roadmap for a green hydrogen economy in Trinidad and Tobago'}}"

This paper discusses the sociotechnical interactions that are driving and hindering development of hydrogen value chains in Norway. The study is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. A multi-level perspective (MLP) is deployed to discuss how exogenous trends and uncertainties interact with processes and strategies in the national energy system, and how this influences the transition potential associated with Norwegian hydrogen production. We explore different transition pathways towards a low-emission society in 2050 and find that Norwegian hydrogen production and its deployment for decarbonization of maritime and heavy-duty transport, decarbonisation of industry and flexibility services may play a crucial role. Currently, the development is at a branching point where national coordination is crucial to unlock the potential.

Yet, for the implementation of hydrogen technologies on a large scale it is necessary to consider social acceptance. Studies on acceptance of hydrogen technologies have resulted in neutral to positive evaluations. This paper extends previous studies by focusing on large-scale hydrogen infrastructure. Within the project ELEGANCY, quantitative data on the acceptance was gathered among the German population. The results confirm the positive perception of hydrogen on a general level. However, the high level of acceptance is decreasing when it comes to infrastructure implementation in the own neighbourhood. In this paper, the gap between acceptance of hydrogen technology on a general level and the level of its infrastructural implementation is analysed, focusing on new pipeline infrastructure. The results show that sociodemographic factors, especially the variable age, as well as project-related factors, especially trust in stakeholders, have a high explanatory power.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'International Journal of Hydrogen Energy', 'year': '2022', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}]","{'10.1016/j.erss.2021.102116': {'authors': [], 'title': 'A hybrid perspective on energy transition pathways: Is hydrogen the key for Norway?

Green hydrogen is considered a potential candidate for fossil fuel soon—however, hydrogen is facing the challenges of storage and transportation. Green ammonia, with its ease of transport and storage, is another promising alternative. Decarbonizing ammonia production is an environmental press toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. This work summarizes the up-to-date progress in the green ammonia production methods. An assessment of the different production methods was conducted to highlight the merits and constraints of each approach. Moreover, the promising applications of green ammonia in the energy sectors were discussed. The various barriers, i.e., technical, economic, environmental, and regulations and policies, facing the widespread of green ammonia were also discussed. Finally, the contribution of green ammonia in achieving the different sustainable development goals was elaborated, focusing on the contribution of green ammonia in achieving climate change (SDG 13), clean energy (SDG 7), and other sustainability-related goals. Low efficiencies, high cost, and negative environmental impacts are the common challenges of the various production methods. The progress in green ammonia is essential for achieving SDG2, “Zero hunger”. SDG3 “healthy life and well-being” and SDG13 “Climate action”, will be achieved by eliminating 3.85\xa0kg CO2-eq/kg NH3 emitted from conventional ammonia-based processes. Ease storing of green ammonia in liquid form (at 9\xa0bar or cooling to −33°); makes it the best green energy source, i.e., achieving SDG7 “green and affordable energy”. By2050, green ammonia is expected to represent 99\xa0% of marine fuel, thus contributing to SDG9 “Industry and Infrastructure”. Moreover, green ammonia production will save 35.2 GJ of natural gas, thus achieving SDG12 “Responsible consumption/production”.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Energy Conversion and Management', 'year': '2023', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.136438', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.136438', 'title': 'Green hydrogen and sustainable development – A social LCA perspective highlighting social hotspots and geopolitical implications of the future hydrogen economy ', 'abstract': '\n                  Developing a global hydrogen economy that contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and achieves net-zero carbon emissions under the Paris Agreement requires evaluating and recognizing the economic, social, and political realities of green hydrogen production. This study performs a cradle-to-gate social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) of green hydrogen production via water electrolysis powered by renewable electricity from solar photovoltaic and wind farms in seven countries (the US, Chile, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Australia, and China) to identify the social hotspots in the entire value chain. The results of S-LCA indicate that green hydrogen production in South Africa poses the highest risk to most of the social indicators, especially child labor, fair salary, unemployment, association and bargaining rights, and gender wage gap. However, in the other countries, the risk to most of the social indicators drastically reduces when key equipment is manufactured in the country itself rather than when it is imported from other countries. Due to the increased complexity of the green hydrogen supply chain resulting from components sourced from various parts of the world, the S-LCA results indicate that compared with conventional hydrogen, green hydrogen performed poorly in various social indicators. The S-LCA results revealed that outsourcing key equipment from developing countries with poor working conditions is a major social hotspot in the sustainable development of these countries. In addition, the S-LCA results demonstrate that the hydrogen economy has the potential to be capable of achieving SDGS by developing a domestic green hydrogen supply chain and enhancing working conditions in country-specific sectors. Furthermore, a holistic discussion of socio-geopolitical implications is presented, emphasizing the need to develop standardized international regulations to prevent colonialism in the future hydrogen economy.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Journal of Cleaner Production', 'year': '2023', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.31219/osf.io/js5hu', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.31219/osf.io/js5hu', 'title': 'Long-term Sustainable Energy Strategy: Cyprus’ Energy Transition to Hydrogen Economy', 'abstract': '', 'authors': ['Andreas Poullikkas'], 'journal': '', 'year': '2020', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.11', 'doi_repaired': '10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113002', 'repair_note': 'repaired_by_elsevier_j_stem:10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.11', 'doi': '10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113002', 'title': 'Proposal and 3E (energy, exergy, and exergoeconomic) assessment of a cogeneration system using an organic Rankine cycle and an Absorption Refrigeration System in the Northeast Brazil: Thermodynamic investigation of a facility case study ', 'abstract': '\n                  This paper proposes a cogeneration system to achieve the partial electric and thermal demands of a building in the public University. This proposed system comprises an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), an organic Rankine cycle (ORC), and equipment that will operate as a sink. For the latter, two types of equipment were selected: a cooling tower and an Absorption Refrigeration System (ARS). The building selected to propose the cogeneration system is the Institute of Sustainable Energies (IES), located at the Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB), in the Northeast of Brazil. The performance of the system based on energetic and exergetic points of view operating under two distinct modes; ORC Simple (ORC-S) and ORC Combined (ORC-C), was compared. Both modes are based on the energy availability of the ICE exhaust gases. The thermodynamic models for both modes were developed based on the first and second laws of thermodynamic considering input parameters, such as inlet temperature, pressure ratio, and outlet temperature of the expander and the cold-water storage tank. For the exergoeconomic technique, the SPECO Method (Specific Exergy Costing) was used and implemented along with the Thermodynamic model. The ORC system studied uses a scroll expander and operates with R-134a as the working fluid and water/ammonia pair for the single-effect ARS. The results showed that the ORC-C mode can meet from 18.9% to 37.5% of the IES electricity demand, while the ORC-S mode can meet from 12.4% to 24.5%. The thermodynamic analysis reported that the ORC-C allowed a 33.6% increase in mechanical power production, an increase from approximately 4.5% to 34.5% in energy efficiency as well as exergy efficiencies around 40% and reduction of the total destroyed exergy. From the exergoeconomic point of view, the specific cost of the chilled water has a slight influence on the total cost of the products, while the specific cost of hot water has a strong influence on the total cost of the products (a variation of approximately 46% for a distinct heat source).\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Energy Conversion and Management', 'year': '2020', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1007/978-3-030-87918-1_4', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1007/978-3-030-87918-1_4', 'title': 'Reducing Emissions', 'abstract': '', 'authors': ['John C.

This article provides synthesised, measurable sustainability criteria for analysing green hydrogen production proposals and strategies. Drawn from expert interviews and an extensive literature review this article proposes that a sustainable hydrogen production should consider six impact categories; Energy transition, Environment, Basic needs, Socio-economy, Electricity supply, and Project planning. The categories are broken down into sixteen measurable sustainability criteria, which are determined with related indicators. The article concludes that low economic costs can never be the only decisive criterion for the hydrogen production; social aspects must be integrated along the entire value chain.

One of the most effective strategies for reducing GHG emissions is to switch from conventional fuels such as heavy fuel oil to alternative fuels.

Economic, technical, and safety factors must be assessed. This paper provides a critical assessment of the potential usage of green hydrogen in the shipping industry with an evaluation of production routes, techno-economic performance, storage, and safety. Benchmarking is also carried out compared to existing ‘grey’ and ‘blue’ production routes specific to shipping industry applications. Important metrics for liquid hydrogen are analyzed to evaluate production cost and GHG emissions for various routes.

However, like other energy production methods, hydrogen comes with challenges, including high costs and safety concerns across its entire value chain. To overcome these, low-cost productions are required along with a promised market. Offshore renewables have an enormous potential to facilitate green hydrogen production on a large scale. Their plummeting cost, technological advances, and rising cost of carbon pave a pathway where green hydrogen can be cost-competitive against fossil-fuel-based hydrogen. Offshore industries, including oil and gas, aquaculture, and shipping, are looking for cleaner energy solutions to decarbonize their systems/operations and can serve as a substantial market. Offshore industrial nexus, moreover, can assist the production, storage, and transmission of green hydrogen through infrastructure sharing and logistical support. The development of offshore green hydrogen production facilities is in its infancy and requires a deeper insight into the key elements that govern decision-making during their life-cycle. This includes the parameters that reflect the performance of hydrogen technology with technical, socio-political, financial, and environmental considerations. Therefore, this study provides critical insight into the influential factors discovered through a comprehensive analysis that governs the development of an offshore green hydrogen system. Insights are also fed into the requirements for modelling and analysis of these factors, considering the synergy of hydrogen production with the offshore industries, coastal hydrogen hub and onshore energy demand. The results of this critical review will assist the researchers and developers in establishing and executing an effective framework for offshore site selection in largely uncertain and hazardous ocean environments. Overall, the study will facilitate the stakeholders and researchers in developing decision-making tools to ensure sustainable and safe offshore green hydrogen facilities.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Process Safety and Environmental Protection', 'year': '2023', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.psep.2023.04', 'doi_repaired': '10.3390/eng4010011', 'repair_note': 'repaired_by_elsevier_j_stem:10.1016/j.psep.2023.04', 'doi': '10.3390/eng4010011', 'title': 'DFN: An Emerging Tool for Stochastic Modelling and Geomechanical Design', 'abstract': '', 'authors': ['Peter Kolapo', 'Nafiu Olanrewaju Ogunsola', 'Prosper Munemo', 'Damilola Alewi', 'Kayode Komolafe', 'Ahmid Giwa-Bioku'], 'journal': 'Eng', 'year': '2023', 'pdf_url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4117/4/1/11/pdf?version=1672907189', 'pdf_source': 'unpaywall', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'request_failed', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.08.111', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.08.111', 'title': 'Sustainable hydrogen roadmap: A holistic review and decision-making methodology for production, utilisation and exportation using Qatar as a case study ', 'abstract': '\n                  Hydrogen is seen as a promising and inevitable energy carrier in the transition towards a carbon-free energy era.

The study aims to introduce a roadmap for current and future exploration of carbon-free hydrogen production and exportation from Qatar, for which an assessment of several available alternatives for the production of hydrogen in Qatar is performed. These alternatives include the use of natural gas as a feedstock for hydrogen production through steam methane reforming (SMR), solar integrated steam methane reforming with carbon capture, as well as the possibilities for hydrogen production from electrolysis using renewables and ammonia as another intermediate. The potential of each alternative is reviewed based on selected technical, economic and environmental criteria. The findings of this review study indicate that the production and exportation of blue ammonia currently present the best pathway for Qatar, while green hydrogen is expected to become as competitive as blue ammonia in the mid-future.

One of the most effective strategies for reducing GHG emissions is to switch from conventional fuels such as heavy fuel oil to alternative fuels. Green hydrogen is a promising alternative for the shipping industry. Nonetheless, its potential usage will depend on more than its environmental friendliness. Economic, technical, and safety factors must be assessed. This paper provides a critical assessment of the potential usage of green hydrogen in the shipping industry with an evaluation of production routes, techno-economic performance, storage, and safety. Benchmarking is also carried out compared to existing ‘grey’ and ‘blue’ production routes specific to shipping industry applications. Important metrics for liquid hydrogen are analyzed to evaluate production cost and GHG emissions for various routes.

LNG had the highest NPV (€6,166 million), followed by methanol (€1,705 million) and green hydrogen (€319 million).

For regions with scarce land resources, this means importing significant volumes of green hydrogen from regions with abundance of renewable energy. In producing countries, this raises significant sustainability questions related to production and export. To assess these sustainability-related opportunities and challenges, the authors first present a review of renewable energy deployment in the electricity sector, and then extend it to the foreseeable opportunities and risks of green hydrogen production in exporting countries. The paper finds that questions of freshwater and land availability are critical from an environmental and a socio-economic point of view, and that the development of international standards for the governance of hydrogen-related projects will be crucial.

In part, this deficit results from domestic farmers rarely using inorganic fertilizer, which is synthesized from fossil fuels internationally. Here, we evaluate the economic benefits of producing green ammonia from renewable local hydropower for low-carbon cost-effective fertilizer production. Its use as fertilizer estimates a 30-year net present value (NPV) of ∼$230M (∼165% return of investment) compared with simply importing fertilizers, which would already save at least $50M a year compared with the current situation of importing rice, but hinges on additional external factors related to implementing modern agriculture. In addition, green ammonia can buffer seasonal fluctuations of hydroelectricity from 900 MW to 50 MW and produce a consistently available 370 MW of power.

Green hydrogen is considered a potential candidate for fossil fuel soon—however, hydrogen is facing the challenges of storage and transportation. Green ammonia, with its ease of transport and storage, is another promising alternative. Decarbonizing ammonia production is an environmental press toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. This work summarizes the up-to-date progress in the green ammonia production methods. An assessment of the different production methods was conducted to highlight the merits and constraints of each approach. Moreover, the promising applications of green ammonia in the energy sectors were discussed. The various barriers, i.e., technical, economic, environmental, and regulations and policies, facing the widespread of green ammonia were also discussed. Finally, the contribution of green ammonia in achieving the different sustainable development goals was elaborated, focusing on the contribution of green ammonia in achieving climate change (SDG 13), clean energy (SDG 7), and other sustainability-related goals. Low efficiencies, high cost, and negative environmental impacts are the common challenges of the various production methods. The progress in green ammonia is essential for achieving SDG2, “Zero hunger”. SDG3 “healthy life and well-being” and SDG13 “Climate action”, will be achieved by eliminating 3.85\xa0kg CO2-eq/kg NH3 emitted from conventional ammonia-based processes. Ease storing of green ammonia in liquid form (at 9\xa0bar or cooling to −33°); makes it the best green energy source, i.e., achieving SDG7 “green and affordable energy”. By2050, green ammonia is expected to represent 99\xa0% of marine fuel, thus contributing to SDG9 “Industry and Infrastructure”. Moreover, green ammonia production will save 35.2 GJ of natural gas, thus achieving SDG12 “Responsible consumption/production”.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Energy Conversion and Management', 'year': '2023', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}]","{'10.1016/j.oneear.2020.12.015': {'authors': [], 'title': 'The potential of green ammonia for agricultural and economic development in Sierra Leone '}, '10.1016/j.oneear.2020.06.017': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Overcoming the Arrogance of Ignorance: Supply-Chain Lessons from COVID-19 for Climate Shocks '}, '10.1016/j.enconman.2022.116594': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Recent progress in Green Ammonia: Production, applications, assessment; barriers, and its role in achieving the sustainable development goals '}}"

For regions with scarce land resources, this means importing significant volumes of green hydrogen from regions with abundance of renewable energy. In producing countries, this raises significant sustainability questions related to production and export. To assess these sustainability-related opportunities and challenges, the authors first present a review of renewable energy deployment in the electricity sector, and then extend it to the foreseeable opportunities and risks of green hydrogen production in exporting countries. The paper finds that questions of freshwater and land availability are critical from an environmental and a socio-economic point of view, and that the development of international standards for the governance of hydrogen-related projects will be crucial. These should also address potential conflicts between the deployment of renewable energy for the decarbonization of local power grids, and the export of green hydrogen.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'International Journal of Hydrogen Energy', 'year': '2023', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01', 'doi_repaired': '10.1159/000536435', 'repair_note': 'repaired_by_elsevier_j_stem:10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01', 'doi': '10.1159/000536435', 'title': 'Prelims', 'abstract': '', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Human Development', 'year': '2023', 'pdf_url': 'https://karger.com/hde/article-pdf/67/5-6/225/4171170/000536435.pdf', 'pdf_source': 'unpaywall', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'request_failed', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.07.229', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.07.229', 'title': 'Is Africa ready for green hydrogen energy takeoff? – A multi-criteria analysis approach to the opportunities and barriers of hydrogen production on the continent ', 'abstract': '\n                  Hydrogen is mostly seen as a potential universal fuel that can be used in place of fossil fuels.

There are however several factors that may either positively or negatively affect the development of green hydrogen on the continent. This study identified some opportunities and barriers to the production of green hydrogen in Africa and used the multi-criteria decision-making approach to prioritize them. The study identified the opportunity to export to EU market (20.90%), availability of RE resources (34.88%), youthful population (13.95%), Agenda 2063 (9.30%), and ammonia production (20.90%) as some of the opportunities available on the continent. The availability of RE resources was selected as the highest opportunity for the development of hydrogen energy in Africa. High cost of hydrogen (11.78%), dealing with the status-quo (8.82%), corruption in the energy sector (4.52%), land availability issues (7.06%), political instabilities and insecurity in certain parts of the continent (11.76%), lack of the needed skills and education (11.76%), limited supporting infrastructure and financing (15.38%), and lack of the needed regulatory and legal framework (28.95%) were identified as some of the barriers that could affect the development and use of hydrogen in Africa.

Thanks to its versatility, green hydrogen could play a significant role in reaching a carbon-free future by 2050. Its adoption will be critical for decarbonizing industrial processes at scale, especially hard-to-abate ones such as steel and cement production. This paper maps the role countries could play in future green hydrogen industrial markets based on three criteria: resource endowment, existing industrial production, and economic relatedness. Our analysis shows how the potential for green hydrogen production and leadership in industrial applications is distributed unequally around the globe. Countries like the United States and China could emerge as frontrunners in future green hydrogen markets and lead in industrial applications, such as ammonia, methanol, and steel production. Other resource-rich countries could upgrade along value chains and compete with import-dependent industrial powers for jobs and market shares. A transition in existing value chains will also give rise to new market and geopolitical dynamics and dependencies. This paper contributes empirical evidence to the debate on the geopolitics of hydrogen and guides in defining strategic industrial policies.\n               ', 'authors': [], 'journal': 'Energy Research & Social Science', 'year': '2022', 'pdf_url': None, 'pdf_source': 'none', 'pdf_local_path': None, 'pdf_save_reason': 'no_url', 'status': 'ok'}, {'doi_original': '10.37256/ges.3220221290', 'doi_repaired': None, 'repair_note': None, 'doi': '10.37256/ges.3220221290', 'title': ""Indo-Pacific Strategy and India's Opportunities and Challenges for  Regional Economic Cooperation and Integration: An Exploratory  Review"", 'abstract': '', 'authors': ['Falendra Kumar Sudan'], 'journal': 'Global Economics Science', 'year': '2022', 'pdf_url': 'https://ojs.wiserpub.com/index.php/GES/article/download/1290/912', 'pdf_source': 'unpaywall', 'pdf_local_path': '/content/downloaded_pdf/10.37256_ges.3220221290.pdf', 'pdf_save_reason': 'saved', 'status': 'ok'}]","{'10.1016/j.erss.2022.102847': {'authors': [], 'title': 'Green hydrogen value chains in the industrial sector—Geopolitical and market implications '}, '10.37256/ges.3220221290': {'authors': ['Falendra Kumar Sudan'], 'title': ""Indo-Pacific Strategy and India's Opportunities and Challenges for  Regional Economic Cooperation and Integration: An Exploratory  Review""}}"
